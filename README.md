In JavaScript, there's something called OOP, so what's actually an OOP and how it works?

"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm used by nearly every developer at some point in their career.
OOP is the most popular programming paradigm and is taught as the standard way to code for most of a programmers educational career."
(Erin Doherty, 2020)
Now we know that OOP is really important for us to build a strong fundamental of programming.

For a better understanding of OOP, I'm going to explain the OOP concept in a simple way.
Apperently, there is a structure or building blocks of OOP which includes:
• Classes
• Objects
• Methods

For more fun, I'm going to take Harry Potter as an example of OOP.
Let's practice these on file index.js so we will have a better understanding about OOP.
